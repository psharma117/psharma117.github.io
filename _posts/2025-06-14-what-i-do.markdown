I have different ways of discussing my research with non-physicists, physics students, and physicists. 
So, I'm going to explain myself in three different ways accordingly. 

# Non-Physicists 
I work on what's called the nuclear many-body problem.
This means I'm trying to contribute to how we understand what happens when we have many protons and neutrons all interacting with each other.
There are a variety of resolution scales that we think of the nuclear many-body problem in: 
- **Quarks and Gluons** are the things that make up all of the particles in a nucleus. 
The application to the many-body problem is primarily (to my knowledge) through a framework called Lattice QCD. 
- **Nucleons and Mesons** are perhaps what you'd see if you looked up nuclei on the internet.
A *nucleon* is a lumped together term for a proton or a neutron.
This is a more "zoomed out" picture of what's happening in an atomic nucleus.
- **Densities and Currents** are a still more zoomed out picture, where we think of the nucleus as a blob of stuff (densities) that can jiggle around and flow (as currents) when we mess with it. 
This is the most "zoomed out" picture that I engage with.
