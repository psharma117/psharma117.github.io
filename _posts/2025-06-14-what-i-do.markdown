I have different ways of discussing my research with non-physicists, physics students, and physicists. 
So, I'm going to explain myself in three different ways accordingly. 

# Non-Physicists 
I work on what's called the nuclear many-body problem.

This means I'm trying to contribute to how we understand what happens when we have many protons and neutrons all interacting with each other at the center of atoms or in stars.
There are a variety of resolution scales that we think of the nuclear many-body problem in: 
- **Quarks and Gluons** are the things that make up all of the particles in a nucleus. 
The application to the many-body problem is primarily (to my knowledge) through a framework called Lattice QCD. 
- **Nucleons and Mesons** are perhaps the first thing you'd see if you looked up nuclei on the internet.
A *nucleon* is a lumped together term for a proton or a neutron.
This is a more "zoomed out" picture of what's happening in an atomic nucleus.
- **Densities and Currents** are a still more zoomed out picture, where we think of the nucleus as a blob of stuff (densities) that can jiggle around and flow (as currents) when we mess with it. 
This is the most "zoomed out" picture that I engage with. 

The name of the theoretical framework for the level of densities and currents is *Density Functional Theory (DFT)*. 
In a more ``zoomed in'' perspective, we would want to calculate (or approximate) the energy of each particle from every other particle.
This gets cumbersome and quite infeasible as the number of particles involved gets larger, like for heavier nuclei. 
In DFT we instead talk about the energy of the system in terms of (at bare minimum) a density of particles.
As an example of the distinction, I can think of the way
