I have different ways of discussing my research with non-physicists, physics students, and physicists. 
So, I'm going to explain myself in three different ways accordingly. 

# Non-Physicists 
I work on what's called the nuclear many-body problem.

This means I'm trying to contribute to how we understand what happens when we have many protons and neutrons all interacting with each other at the center of atoms or in stars.
There are a variety of resolution scales that we think of the nuclear many-body problem in: 
- **Quarks and Gluons** are the things that make up all of the particles in a nucleus. 
The application to the many-body problem is primarily (to my knowledge) through a framework called Lattice QCD. 
- **Nucleons and Mesons** are perhaps the first thing you'd see if you looked up nuclei on the internet.
A *nucleon* is a lumped together term for a proton or a neutron.
This is a more "zoomed out" picture of what's happening in an atomic nucleus.
- **Densities and Currents** are a still more zoomed out picture, where we think of the nucleus as a blob of stuff (densities) that can jiggle around and flow (as currents) when we mess with it. 
This is the most "zoomed out" picture that I engage with. 

The name of the theoretical framework for the level of densities and currents is *Density Functional Theory (DFT)*. 
In a more ''zoomed in'' perspective, we would want to calculate (or approximate) the energy of each particle from every other particle.
This gets cumbersome and quite infeasible as the number of particles involved gets larger, like for heavier nuclei. 
In DFT we instead talk about the energy of the system in terms of (at bare minimum) a density of particles.

As a very simplified example of the distinction between zoom levels, I can think of the way individual H$_2$O molecules are interacting when I have water in a bucket, or I can just talk about the distribution of water at different points in the bucket. 
If we leave the water alone and it's allowed to just relax, we know it'll settle and form a cylinder with a flat top inside the bucket.
This is known as the *ground state* of the water. 
In this simple analogy, DFT says that if you have the correct shape that the water is distributed in while it's in its ground state, you can get all measurable properties of the system. 
To do something roughly like DFT on the water, we'd then need a good model of how water behaves, which accurately includes features such as water's surface tension (in case we put it in a container that it completely fills), its viscosity (if we poke the water, it doesn't stay dented for a while), and so on. 
The technical term for such a model is the Energy Density Functional (EDF). 
Slightly more specifically, the EDF is a rule that says: If you give me some description of the distribution of whatever you're describing, I'll tell you the energy associated with it.

As a reminder, the water bucket is a very simplified analogy to help me communicate the ideas involved in my work.
The EDF tells us all the energies that we could get, but we don't know the correct EDF!
Informed by experimental findings, we can write down EDFs that we can make match data to good precision.
This is what's done currently, and it has worked pretty well at matching results that we measure, with some changes of numbers in the EDF to emphasize different features of different kinds of nuclei.
